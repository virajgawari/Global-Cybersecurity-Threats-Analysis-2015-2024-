# Global Cybersecurity Threats Analysis (2015-2024)

This project analyzes cybersecurity threats and incidents from 2015 to 2024 using data analysis and visualization techniques. The analysis provides insights into various aspects of cyber attacks including attack types, target industries, financial impacts, and more.

## Project Overview

The project uses Python with Jupyter Notebook to analyze a dataset containing information about cyber attacks, including:
- Attack types and sources
- Target industries
- Financial losses
- Number of affected users
- Security vulnerabilities
- Defense mechanisms
- Incident resolution times

## Features

- Comprehensive data analysis of cyber attacks from 2015-2024
- Visualization of key trends and patterns
- Analysis of attack types and their impacts
- Industry-specific threat analysis
- Financial impact assessment
- Security vulnerability analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cybersecurity_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Data Structure

The dataset contains the following columns:
- Country
